# WhereToEat.io

Sometimes, choosing what or where to eat can be the hardest decision of the entire day, especially with multiple people. This FullStack collaborative restaurant picker web app helps with just that. Implemented with **Python Flask** for the backend API and **React.js** utilizing the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework on the front. This web app chooses the most “agreed” on restaurant from the users’ input.
